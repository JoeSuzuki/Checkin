# Time Flex
## What it does
Time Flex allows the user to join a group, find the time that fits them and then check-in. This removes the annoying receptionists that you had to talk to in order to make an appointment as well as the time trouble that occurs when a person takes more time than expected. Time Track version 2 (coming soon) will allow time to be added to each person that is affected by the unexpected time delay.

Time Track version 2 (coming soon) example"

I have a doctors appointment at 11 PM.

Someone before me has an appointment at 10 PM.

The person before me takes a hour to finish his appointment -> When the current time hits my time, it will update my time by adding the number of minutes. This will let the other people checked in to see the new time in which they have to come in.
